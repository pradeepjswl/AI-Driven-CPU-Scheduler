# 🤖 AI-Driven CPU Scheduler

A modern, intelligent CPU scheduling system that dynamically selects the most appropriate scheduling algorithm using AI. Built with Python and Streamlit, featuring a beautiful neon-themed interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Dynamic algorithm selection based on system metrics
- ⚡ Support for multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - 🔄 First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - ⚡ Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - ⭐ Priority Scheduling
  - 🔁 Round Robin
- 🎨 Interactive web interface with neon theme
- 📊 Visual representation using Gantt charts
- 📈 Real-time performance metrics
- 🤖 AI-driven decision making

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-cpu-scheduler
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💫 Usage

1. Start the web interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Using the interface:
   - 📊 Click "Generate Training Data" in the sidebar to create initial training data
   - ➕ Add processes using the input fields
   - ▶️ Click "Run Scheduling" to execute the selected algorithm
   - 📈 View the results, including:
     - 🎯 Selected algorithm
     - 📋 Process execution details
     - 📊 Performance metrics
     - 📈 Gantt chart visualization

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📝 **Process Input**: Users input process details through the web interface
2. 📊 **System Metrics**: The system analyzes current processes to extract relevant metrics
3. 🤖 **AI Selection**: A trained model selects the most appropriate scheduling algorithm
4. ⚡ **Execution**: The selected algorithm is executed on the processes
5. 📈 **Results**: Results are displayed with visualizations and metrics

## 🧪 Training Data

The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to select the best algorithm. Training data is generated by:
- 🎲 Creating random process sets
- 📊 Evaluating all algorithms on each set
- 🎯 Selecting the algorithm with the best performance
- 🔍 Using system metrics as features

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The system monitors and analyzes:
- ⏱️ Average Waiting Time
- 🔄 Average Turnaround Time
- 📈 Process characteristics (burst time, priority, arrival time)
- 📊 System load (number of processes)
